### When does a liquidation happen?

To determine whether a loan can be appropriately liquidated there are three important variables being used; the loan’s Threshold Price (TP), the loan’s Neutral Price(NP) and the pool’s Lowest Utilized Price (LUP). TP is set by the borrower and is a loan’s debt divided by the collateral. A pool’s LUP is defined as the lowest collateral price bucket against which someone is actively borrowing. If the borrower’s TP crosses above the LUP, then their position is eligible for liquidation. The NP of a loan is set at origination and acts as the liquidation price of the loan. Meaning that a loan must be both eligible and out of position with respect to the NP for it to be profitably liquidated. A loan is liquidatable when the market price of the collateral crosses below the NP.
