### What are reserves?

Reserves are a balance of funds that are collected from Origination Fees, Net Interest Margin and Penalties. Each pool has a reserve, denominated in the pool's quote token.  Reserves act as backup funds for covering bad debt and are also used for buying and burning AJNA tokens through reserve auctions.

### What is a reserve auction?

A reserve auction is a sale of pool reserves for AJNA tokens. It is a Dutch auction whose proceeds are permanently destroyed.

### When do reserve auctions occur?

Reserve auctions occur when enough claimable reserves accumulate such that the person triggering the reserve auction makes more money than the transaction costs. There is a 1% of claimable reserves reward for triggering a reserve auction. Additionally, reserve auctions can occur at a maximum of once every two weeks per pool.

### Who triggers reserve auctions, is there an incentive?

Anyone can trigger a reserve auction and the reward for doing so is 1% of the claimable reserves.

### How do I participate in a reserve auction?

Through your interface of choice.
