### What is Quadratic Voting?

Quadratic voting is a system that allows individuals to express their preferences using a budget of voting points. Unlike traditional "one person, one vote" systems, individuals can allocate their voting points based on the importance of the issue to them, giving more weight to their individual opinions. The allocation of voting points follows a quadratic function, which means that the cost of allocating additional voting points to a single issue increases as more voting points are allocated to that issue. This system incentivizes people to vote on the issues they care about most and can lead to a more accurate and nuanced representation of individual preferences, particularly on complex or controversial issues.
